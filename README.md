# toku_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Our application is a user-friendly tool for learning the basics of the Japanese language. It covers numbers, family members, colors, and common phrases, all translated into Japanese. The app also provides audio recordings spoken by native Japanese speakers to help users improve their pronunciation. It's a convenient way to learn and practice essential Japanese language skills.
